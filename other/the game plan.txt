say we want a psd (power spectral density) threshold of some value. 

limit the field of view of the graph to just show points at which the psd = the threshold

we have an expected distance between beep, we will check if the distance between the first 2 intersections is less than the estimate - some tolerance

if it is then we know the the 2 intersections are part of the same spike. we can take the average of the intersection points and find the frequency at the average and this will be a rough guess of the frequency of the beep.

if the gap between them is equal to or larger than the estimate - the tolerance, we know we are in a gap between beeps



eliminates the need for guessing where the spikes are and ensures the right number of beeps are recorded

sacrifices some image accuracy but it should only be by a very small factor
